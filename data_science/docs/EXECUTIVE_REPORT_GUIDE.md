2. **Data Overview** (collection, size, missing values, target variable analysis)
3. **Analytical Insights** (3+ visualizations with deep analysis)
4. **Methodology** (high-level ML model explanations)
5. **Key Results** (metrics, recommendations, business implications)
6. **Conclusion** (successes, challenges, next steps)

## 🚀 How to Use

### Basic Usage

Simply ask the agent:
```
"Generate an executive report"
"Create a comprehensive project report"
"Export a full report with all sections"
```

### Advanced Usage with Custom Parameters

```python
export_executive_report(
    project_title="Student Performance Analysis",
    business_problem="Schools need to identify at-risk students early to provide targeted interventions",
    business_objective="Build a predictive model to forecast final grades (G3) with 85%+ accuracy",
    target_variable="G3",
    recommendations=[
        "Implement early warning system based on G1 and G2 grades",
        "Focus tutoring resources on students predicted to score below 10",
